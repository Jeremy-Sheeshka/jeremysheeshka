He believed that computers and AI would one day be able to reason as humans do, asserting 'that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it' (McCarthy, What is Artificial Intelligence?)."

     Simon was a cognitive psychologist and AI pioneer who researched decision-making processes.

He believed intelligence could be identified in systems that use symbolic representations and selective search strategies, asserting that “machines will be capable of doing any work a man can do.” (Simon, quoted in 'Herbert A.

Gebru is a renowned computer scientist who’s contributions towards AI are rooted in exposing systemic bias and social harms. Gebru believes intelligence cannot be identified in current AI and that machine learning lacks true understanding and impartiality. She finds that AI only replicates patterns learned from datasets and requires greater ethical oversight. “We are working at a scale where the people building the things can’t actually get their arms around the data,”(Gebru, quoted in 'Google’s star AI ethics researcher...', MIT Technology Review)

## Thinking about language


Machine languages fundamentally differ from human languages in that they rely on strict predefined structures, do not evolve organically, or respond to cultural influences. They are systems of symbols and rules designed to enable humans to control a machine's actions and output. In contrast, human languages are spoken, interpreted, and vary widely across cultures with an ability to convey emotional nuance. While both types of languages serve the purpose of communication, machine languages are deterministic and task-oriented, while human languages are expressive, flexible, and shaped by social and cultural contexts (Harris, 2018).

<br>

## Thinking about intelligence


Machine intelligence seems to be directly proportional to the confines of its programming and data. Its output depends entirely on pre-existing input, leaving little room for creativity and abstract reasoning. 
Unlike humans, machines cannot transfer knowledge or develop new and original ideas, making AI inherently limited in depth amd adaptability (Crawford, 2021). AI systems struggle to generalize beyond predefinited parameters or use prior experience to navigate unfamilliar situations (Chollet, 2019). While AI may outperform humans in repetitive tasks, logic, or games, such achievements reflected programmed skill and not true intelligence or understanding. 



## Machine Learning vs Human Learning

Human learning is multidimensional and shaped by sensory input, experiences, and social contexts that collectively influence how our knowledge and understandings develop. In contrast, machine learning occurs in two main ways: by encoding prior knowledge directly into the system or by training it on large datasets to improve task-specific objectives (Chollet, 2019). The effectiveness of machine learning depends heavily on the quality of its training data (Heilweil, 2020). While both humans and machines are influenced by the contexts of their training, machines lack the adaptive depth of human experience, understandings and reasonings such that machine learning can significantly amplify systemic issues due to biased programming and training data (Crawford, 2021).
