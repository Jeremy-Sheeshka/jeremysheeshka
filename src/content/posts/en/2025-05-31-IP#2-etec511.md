  'analysis-button1': [  // Alan Turing
    "Alan Turing, mathematician and codebreaker, saw intelligence as machines passing the Turing Test — imitating human conversation. He laid AI’s theoretical groundwork with the Turing Machine concept, shaping modern computing and artificial intelligence’s foundations through his vision of computation and machine cognition.",
    "Turing believed machines exhibit intelligence if they can mimic human responses indistinguishably. His pioneering work on algorithms and the Turing Test forged the conceptual bedrock for AI, influencing both theoretical computer science and the philosophical debates around machine intelligence and consciousness.",
    "A visionary in computation, Turing defined intelligence via imitation—if a machine’s responses are indistinguishable from a human’s, it is intelligent. His foundational Turing Machine and cryptanalysis work catalyzed AI, merging computation theory with machine learning’s conceptual beginnings.",
    "Turing, a trailblazer in computing, posited intelligence emerges from machines simulating human behavior, formalized in the Turing Test. His abstract models of computation established AI’s theoretical basis, inspiring decades of research on machine intelligence and cognitive simulation."
  ],

  'analysis-button2': [  // John McCarthy
    "John McCarthy coined ‘Artificial Intelligence’ and believed intelligence is symbol manipulation reflecting human reasoning. He invented LISP, enabling symbolic AI research, and his logic-based frameworks fostered AI’s academic and practical growth, emphasizing formal reasoning and knowledge representation.",
    "McCarthy viewed intelligence as symbolic reasoning, formalizing AI’s goals through logic and knowledge representation. His creation of LISP empowered AI programming, and his vision established AI as a distinct scientific discipline focused on emulating human thought processes.",
    "A founder of AI, McCarthy emphasized machines’ ability to process symbols and reason logically. His development of LISP revolutionized AI programming and framed intelligence as computable symbolic manipulation, anchoring AI’s theoretical and practical dimensions.",
    "McCarthy advanced AI by defining intelligence as logic-driven symbol manipulation. Through LISP and formal frameworks, he structured AI research, advocating for machines capable of reasoning, problem-solving, and knowledge representation that mirror human cognition."
  ],

  'analysis-button3': [  // Herbert Simon
    "Herbert Simon saw intelligence as decision-making within cognitive limits. He introduced bounded rationality, modeling how humans make satisficing choices. Simon’s AI contributions bridged cognitive science and economics, creating early AI programs like the Logic Theorist simulating human problem-solving.",
    "Simon’s view of intelligence focused on realistic human reasoning, limited by cognitive constraints. His interdisciplinary work connected psychology and AI, pioneering AI programs that mimic human thought processes and highlighting decision-making’s role in intelligent behavior.",
    "Simon redefined intelligence as bounded rational decision-making, acknowledging cognitive limitations. His AI contributions, including early problem-solving programs, integrated cognitive science insights, fostering AI models that emulate human heuristics and satisficing rather than perfect logic.",
    "An interdisciplinary thinker, Simon modeled intelligence as satisficing decisions under constraints. His AI work demonstrated machines could emulate human reasoning patterns, laying groundwork for AI systems that reflect human cognitive limitations and decision heuristics."
  ],

  'analysis-button4': [  // Marvin Minsky
    "Marvin Minsky viewed intelligence as a composite of interacting processes. He founded the Society of Mind theory, describing intelligence emerging from simple agents collaborating. His work pioneered AI’s cognitive architectures, blending symbolic and connectionist ideas to explore machine thought complexity.",
    "Minsky defined intelligence as multiple mental agents’ interactions forming complex cognition. He co-founded MIT’s AI Lab and developed cognitive frameworks that shaped modern AI, exploring perception, reasoning, and creativity beyond rule-based logic.",
    "Minsky’s vision framed intelligence as distributed processes collaborating, introducing the Society of Mind theory. His foundational AI research bridged symbolic and neural approaches, expanding AI’s scope into cognitive architectures and theories of machine consciousness.",
    "As an AI pioneer, Minsky proposed intelligence arises from many simple interacting processes. His work on mental agent theory and cognitive architectures inspired hybrid AI models, expanding understanding of machine intelligence beyond symbolic logic."
  ],

  'analysis-button5': [  // Timnit Gebru
    "Timnit Gebru is an AI ethicist focusing on fairness and bias. She highlights societal impacts of AI, advocating for transparency and accountability. Gebru’s work challenges AI research to incorporate ethics and diversity, shaping responsible AI development and policy frameworks.",
    "Gebru identifies intelligence in AI not only technically but ethically, emphasizing bias mitigation and social justice. Her research on AI fairness and transparency drives efforts to build equitable AI systems that reflect diverse human values.",
    "An advocate for ethical AI, Gebru explores how bias affects intelligence models and AI’s societal role. Her work promotes transparency, diversity, and accountability, pushing AI towards fairness and inclusivity in design and deployment.",
    "Gebru’s pioneering research centers on AI ethics, revealing hidden biases and advocating for diverse representation. She redefines intelligence to include social responsibility, influencing AI governance and the creation of equitable, trustworthy AI systems."
