  intro: "OK, no one actually asks any of these things _frequently_, but I figured I'll answer them anyway."
  items:
    - summary: "Do you teach guitar lessons privately?"
      contents: "  I teach everyone uniquely and don't have generic lesson plans. I feel I can better serve you by exploring the guitar together with you. We can build a personal plan for your growth and needs as a guitarist. I love music deeply and it has given me many blessings as I have been putting my energy into it. Many of my dearest friendships are with fellow musicians. I am blessed to be able to pursue it at all. I'm also grateful for the opportunity to teach others a bit about what I've been spending a lot of my life doing."

    - summary: "How long have you been playing guitar for? "
      contents: "I'm still learning, certainly for a lifetime. It's the eternal repetition of learning and applying: building something. I always read some book about bash scripts, typography, grid layouts, JavaScript, web components. I read articles that people from the community so lovingly provide. When I build a new project, I always try to learn something new in the process. And so everything becomes more and more natural, logical, easy, and better, over time."

As a Musician, my music aims to pay tribute to both traditional idioms and emerging trends inspired by musical innovations and contemporary technologies that lend itself to a variety of popular and experimental forms and stylistic mediums.

I seek to create music that explores and draws upon relationships between people and places, improvisation and composition, as well as the familiar and abstract.

In the role of educator, Jeremy believes that learning is a lifelong journey and that the best way to reinforce onesâ€™ understanding of something is through sharing with others, whether that be through music, art, electronics, or web friendly technologies. My work strives to inspire and invigorate new understandings for emerging creative minds everywhere.<sparkly-text class="pl-2xs" number-of-sparkles="5" style="--sparkly-text-color: var(--color-accent)">**bring joy**.</sparkly-text>
