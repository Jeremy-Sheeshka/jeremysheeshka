  title: I build creative experiences through technology.
  intro: I’ve worked as an educator in elementary and high schools since 2016. As a musician and lifelong learner, I bring a creative approach to technology. Whether teaching guitar or building digital tools, I focus on clarity and structure. I design user-friendly websites and interactive experiences that prioritize performance, accessibility, and simplicity for individuals, educators, artists, and organizations.

I design and build fast, accessible websites from scratch — no templates, no shortcuts — using clean, reliable code shaped by my background in music, guitar, and education. Just like in jazz, I value structure, clarity, and flow, whether I’m helping someone navigate a learning platform, share their creative work, or explore new technologies for teaching and music-making. My goal is to make tools that are intuitive, sustainable, and genuinely helpful for learners, educators, and artists alike.

<!-- 

I make sure that a website is fast and loads only what is necessary. Everyone should be able to find their way around immediately and a website should be ==accessible and usable for as many people as possible.==

I do not create websites based on premade templates/themes and I do not use website builders. I plan, design and program all websites from scratch, usually using a foundation (“starter”) I have developed for the basics.

This approach has various advantages:

1. No image is too big, no code is too much - and the website runs error-free and extremely fast.
2. I am independent of third parties, both from persons or external code: I react to problems and necessary updates myself.
3. I create semantically structured websites with human-written, approachable contents that are highly discoverable without the need for additional SEO efforts.
4. Truly, we can realize almost anything you can imagine!
