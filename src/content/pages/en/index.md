I consider my approach to music, education, and technology to be human-centric; placing people, their goals, and their needs at the forefront of my practice. This philosophy guides my designs decisions, and informs my practice towards developing meaningful experiences and responsive applications of technology. Whether I’m helping someone navigate a learning platform, sharing a creative project, or supporting others in using technology, I aim to to make the process intuitive, sustainable, and genuinely helpful for learners, educators, and artists alike.
