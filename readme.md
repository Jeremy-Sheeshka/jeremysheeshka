This is my personal website intended to provide a platform and starting point for me to hone my abilities in working with different web-platform technologies including Tailwind, Nunjucks, Eleventy, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The inspiration to start this blog and to branch out into learning these technologies comes from Lene Saile and her work with Eleventy and web-technologies.
